        <h1>Cricket</h1>
        <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of
            <mark>eleven players</mark> on a field at the centre of which is a
            <span>22-yard pitch</span> with a wicket at each end, each comprising
            two bails balanced on <code>three stumps</code>.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket
            with the bat, while the
            <abbr title="Bowling and Fielding">bowling and fielding</abbr> side
            tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter.
